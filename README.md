# KKT-Conditions-Tester-1st-and-2nd-Order-Matlab
MATLAB implementation for verifying 1st and 2nd order KKT optimality conditions. This tool automates the combinatorial check of all possible active and inactive constraint sets for first-order conditions and evaluates the Hessian of the Lagrangian for second-order conditions in constrained optimization problems.
